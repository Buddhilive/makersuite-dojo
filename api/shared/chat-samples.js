First, it is important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. You can drink water, sports drinks, or clear broth. It is also important to rest and avoid strenuous activity. If you are vomiting, you may need to eat bland foods that are easy to digest, such as toast or crackers. You should also avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can dehydrate you.\n\nIf you have severe symptoms, such as dehydration or bloody diarrhea, you may need to see a doctor. You may also need to see a doctor if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system, or have a chronic medical condition.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to prevent food poisoning.
